# Women-s-Safety-App
This is a women's safety app that allows them to save emergency contacts. If the user taps the power button three times, an emergency message with their live location is sent to their contacts, and a phone call is made to the first contact even if the phone is locked. Tapping the power button three more times triggers a siren alarm.
